# About Me

I am a post-graduate student (Engineering Science - Electrical Engineering) at The university of Queensland and I am currently learning computer vision and deep learning.

I am currently doing a research regarding Terahertz radiation system. The purpose is to test the performance of THz Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) on detecting the moisture level of human being's skin.

Please get in touch if you have any feedback or questions.
